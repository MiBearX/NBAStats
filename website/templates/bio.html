        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a recent computer science graduate from the University of California, Irvine. I'm interested in software development 
            and my goal is to become a software engineer.
        </p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
            I have experience programming in Java, Python and C++, and have a strong interest in AI and machine learning. I've recently completed an intership at SkyNote (Music Technology Group), where I developed an browser-based AI application for violin sound classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on mel-spectrograms and deployed with ONNX. The project involved building a data processing pipeline which segmented audio inputs, generated spectrograms, and visualized model outputs with Chart.js. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why Choose Me?</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about software development and am constantly seeking opportunities for growth and learning. I strive to gain a deeper understanding of programming and I am looking to gain essential industry experience through an internship this coming summer.
            If you're looking for a good communicator and someone who is thrilled to learn, please feel free to contact me.
